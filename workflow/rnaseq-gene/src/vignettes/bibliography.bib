@article{Hardcastle2010BaySeq,
  abstract =	 {{BACKGROUND:High throughput sequencing has become an important
                  technology for studying expression levels in many types of genomic, and
                  particularly transcriptomic, data. One key way of analysing such data is
                  to look for elements of the data which display particular patterns of
                  differential expression in order to take these forward for further
                  analysis and validation.RESULTS:We propose a framework for defining
                  patterns of differential expression and develop a novel algorithm,
                  baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns
                  of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples. The
                  method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data and derives
                  an empirically determined prior distribution from the entire dataset. We
                  examine the performance of the method on real and simulated
                  data.CONCLUSIONS:Our method performs at least as well, and often better,
                  than existing methods for analyses of pairwise differential expression
                  in both real and simulated data. When we compare methods for the
                  analysis of data from experimental designs involving multiple sample
                  groups, our method again shows substantial gains in performance. We
                  believe that this approach thus represents an important step forward for
                  the analysis of count data from sequencing experiments.}},

@article{Himes2014RNASeq,
  abstract =	 {{Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects over
                  300 million people worldwide. Glucocorticoids are a mainstay therapy for
                  asthma because they exert anti-inflammatory effects in multiple lung
                  tissues, including the airway smooth muscle (ASM). However, the
                  mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation in ASM remains
                  poorly understood. Using RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing method,
                  we characterized transcriptomic changes in four primary human ASM cell
                  lines that were treated with dexamethasone--a potent synthetic
                  glucocorticoid (1 µM for 18 hours). Based on a Benjamini-Hochberg
                  corrected p-value <0.05, we identified 316 differentially expressed
                  genes, including both well known (DUSP1, KLF15, PER1, TSC22D3) and less
                  investigated (C7, CCDC69, CRISPLD2) glucocorticoid-responsive
                  genes. CRISPLD2, which encodes a secreted protein previously implicated
                  in lung development and endotoxin regulation, was found to have SNPs
                  that were moderately associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance
                  and bronchodilator response among asthma patients in two previously
                  conducted genome-wide association studies. Quantitative RT-PCR and
                  Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly
                  increased CRISPLD2 mRNA and protein expression in ASM cells. CRISPLD2
                  expression was also induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL1β, and small
                  interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRISPLD2 further increased
                  IL1β-induced expression of IL6 and IL8. Our findings offer a
                  comprehensive view of the effect of a glucocorticoid on the ASM
                  transcriptome and identify CRISPLD2 as an asthma pharmacogenetics
                  candidate gene that regulates anti-inflammatory effects of
                  glucocorticoids in the ASM.}},

                  amounts of complex data that are difficult to process and share with
                  collaborators. Standard methods are needed to transform such data into a
                  more useful and intuitive format. We present ReportingTools, a
                  Bioconductor package, that automatically recognizes and transforms the
                  output of many common Bioconductor packages into rich, interactive,
                  HTML-based reports. Reports are not generic, but have been individually
                  designed to reflect content specific to the result type
                  detected. Tabular output included in reports is sortable, filterable and
                  searchable and contains context-relevant hyperlinks to external
                  databases. Additionally, in-line graphics have been developed for
                  specific analysis types and are embedded by default within table rows,
                  providing a useful visual summary of underlying raw data. ReportingTools

                  any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several
                  dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at
                  http://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps,
                  mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions,
                  cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms,
                  sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and
                  more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches
                  provide quick and precise access to any region of specific
                  interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence
                  details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation
                  tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from
                  publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the
                  rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for

                  batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of statistical
                  inference in genomic experiments. These sources of noise must be modeled
                  and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain
                  correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic
                  analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating
                  these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only
                  affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal
                  components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The
                  resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as
                  adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the
                  sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from
                  sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also

                  and differentiation, as well as in manifestation of disease. RNA-seq
                  experiments allow for the identification of differentially expressed
                  (DE) genes and their corresponding isoforms on a genome-wide
                  scale. However, statistical methods are required to ensure that accurate
                  identifications are made. A number of methods exist for identifying DE
                  genes, but far fewer are available for identifying DE isoforms. When
                  isoform DE is of interest, investigators often apply gene-level
                  (count-based) methods directly to estimates of isoform counts. Doing so
                  is not recommended. In short, estimating isoform expression is
                  relatively straightforward for some groups of isoforms, but more
                  challenging for others. This results in estimation uncertainty that
                  varies across isoform groups. Count-based methods were not designed to
                  accommodate this varying uncertainty, and consequently, application of
                  them for isoform inference results in reduced power for some classes of
                  isoforms and increased false discoveries for others.}},

                  unproven and remains controversial. Here we investigate the role played
                  by ncRNAs in the stress response of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We
                  integrate global proteomics and RNA sequencing data to identify a

                  that have the potential to influence multiple pathways. Deletion of one

                  the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each
                  exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read

@article{Robinson2009EdgeR,
  abstract =	 {{It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies
                  will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many
                  functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis
                  tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining
                  whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                  significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a
                  Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of
                  replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account
                  for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods
                  are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
                  improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even
                  with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one
                  phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have
                  other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide
                  count data.  The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from
                  the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).}},

@article{Witten2011Classification,
  abstract =	 {{In recent years, advances in high throughput sequencing technology have
                  led to a need for specialized methods for the analysis of digital gene
                  expression data. While gene expression data measured on a microarray
                  take on continuous values and can be modeled using the normal
                  distribution, RNA sequencing data involve nonnegative counts and are
                  more appropriately modeled using a discrete count distribution, such as
                  the Poisson or the negative binomial. Consequently, analytic tools that
                  assume a Gaussian distribution (such as classification methods based on
                  linear discriminant analysis and clustering methods that use Euclidean
                  distance) may not perform as well for sequencing data as methods that
                  are based upon a more appropriate distribution. Here, we propose new
                  approaches for performing classification and clustering of observations
                  on the basis of sequencing data. Using a Poisson log linear model, we
                  develop an analog of diagonal linear discriminant analysis that is
                  appropriate for sequencing data. We also propose an approach for
                  clustering sequencing data using a new dissimilarity measure that is
                  based upon the Poisson model. We demonstrate the performances of these
                  approaches in a simulation study, on three publicly available RNA
                  sequencing data sets, and on a publicly available chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation sequencing data set.}},

  abstract =	 {{Recent developments in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology have led to
                  a rapid increase in gene expression data in the form of counts. RNA-seq
                  can be used for a variety of applications, however, identifying
                  differential expression (DE) remains a key task in functional
                  genomics. There have been a number of statistical methods for DE
                  detection for RNA-seq data. One common feature of several leading
                  methods is the use of the negative binomial (Gamma–Poisson mixture)
                  model. That is, the unobserved gene expression is modeled by a gamma
                  random variable and, given the expression, the sequencing read counts
                  are modeled as Poisson. The distinct feature in various methods is how
                  the variance, or dispersion, in the Gamma distribution is modeled and
                  estimated. We evaluate several large public RNA-seq datasets and find
                  that the estimated dispersion in existing methods does not adequately
                  capture the heterogeneity of biological variance among samples. We
                  present a new empirical Bayes shrinkage estimate of the dispersion
                  parameters and demonstrate improved DE detection.}},
