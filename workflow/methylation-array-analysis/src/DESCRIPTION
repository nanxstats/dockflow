Description: Methylation in the human genome is known to be associated with 
        development and disease. The Illumina Infinium methylation arrays are by far 
        the most common way to interrogate methylation across the human genome. This 
        Bioconductor workflow uses multiple packages for the analysis 
        of methylation array data. Specifically, we demonstrate the steps involved in a 
        typical differential methylation analysis pipeline including: quality control, 
        filtering, normalization, data exploration and statistical testing for 
        probe-wise differential methylation. We further outline other analyses such as 
        differential methylation of regions, differential variability analysis, 
        estimating cell type composition and gene ontology testing. Finally, we provide 
        some examples of how to visualise methylation array data.
